## About the Video Course
Being able to perform machine learning in C++ will make you a very desirable hiring target. Not that you wouldn’t be if you used any other language but, the truth is that machine learning in C++ is a great combination that is likely to give you access to very interesting positions!

In this course, we focus on the practical part of machine learning—employing different C++ libraries. Several popular machine learning libraries currently exist—we’ll review them and you’ll become familiar with four of them. We use examples of standard machine learning algorithms implemented through the libraries. The course ends with hints that will help you to choose a library depending on the requirements of the situation. 

Taking this course will not only help you build a familiarity with existing machine learning libraries, but also solve complex machine learning problems.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This course is for users with C++ experience who want an introduction to machine learning libraries at a high level. We won’t be going into any mathematical detail, so an understanding of the mathematics behind the algorithm is not essential, however, it will certainly be an advantage.
